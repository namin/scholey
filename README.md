# Scholey

multi-stage programming from Scheme to SMT

Scholey is a smaller alternative to [Holey](https://github.com/namin/holey), using Scheme instead of Python.

At this point, it is a stub implemented mostly by ChatGPT to show how to use a roll-your-own generic execution of procedures that build SMT constraints as a side effect.
